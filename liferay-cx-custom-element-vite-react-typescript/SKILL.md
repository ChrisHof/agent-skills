2. Create a new folder with the name of the client extension in either the **_client-extensions_** subdirectory of the current workspace or - if not available - in the current directory.
3. Replace **_liferay-cx-custom-element_** in all files of the template with the given name of the client extension.
4. Run `yarn` or - if not available - `npm i` to install the dependencies.
